# Think of 2-D arrays like a table with rows and columns, where the dimension represents the row and the index represents the column.

# Example
# Access the element on the first row, second column:


Array = np.array([[2,3,4,5,8],[4,9,7,3,6]])

print("Acces The 2-nd Element From Raw In 2-D Array ", Array[0 ,1])
